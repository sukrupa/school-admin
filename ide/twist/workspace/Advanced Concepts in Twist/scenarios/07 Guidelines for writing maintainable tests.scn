We have taken a brief look at some the concepts in Twist. Here are some guidelines that we think help create mantainable test suites.

h1.Abstractions
Writing your scenarios at the right level of abstraction is critical to building an effective test suite. Here are a few guidelines that can help
	
Tests should be independent of the user interface of the application. 
Tests should strive to be at the highest level of abstraction possible, without sacrificing readabilty.
Don’t repeat yourself: Repeating a series of steps at any level – at a scenario, or in the implementation can increase the maintenance overhead.

    *	Note: The Screen / Page object pattern is a nice way to group all the actions that are possible on a given screen as operations on a class.


h1.Contexts
Using Contexts appropriately can help keep your Scenarios simple. Actions that are part of the execution of scenario, but not relevant directly to 
the test should be modelled as a Context.

h1.Tags
Tags provide you with the ability to quickly select a subset of your scenarios for execution. Appropriate tagging can help you idenfity the scenarios 
affected when you make changes to the application.

Some of the suggested ways of tagging scenarios are:-
		1. Based on feature covered
	    2. Type of test (smoke, regression and so on)
		3. In progress. (This allows you to quickly isolate scenarios that you are not complete yet from being built)
